How this may be organized

Just using web.py for the front end probably.
two pages
    page where you pick the two pages, (has all the validity checking)
    sends the form to some backend python
    backend returns just a simple list of the path
    then second frontend page can display it however I want to.

backend python
takes two pages -> returns list of links between them.

python functions needed
    wikipedia parser, takes a link, returns a node
    all my searching stuff.
